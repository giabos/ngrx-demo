To pick up the vehicle you (or your driver) always must present the Pick-up Authorization and personal identity document. Please contact the pick-up location at least 24 hours before collection. <br /> 3. Transferring this Pick-up Authorization to a third party means you give the authorization to act in your name. The responsibility of the vehicle is transferred as soon as the Pick-up Authorization is presented and signed off at the parking lot, even if it is a third party (transport company for instance). <br /> <br /> <strong>Where do you have to use the Certificate of Delivery for?</strong><br /><br /> 1. A Certificate of Delivery is a document that confirms you <strong><u>have received</u></strong> the vehicle. <a href=\"https://cms.adesa.eu/docs/default-source/cod-cmr/deliverydoc---john-doe---20171226.png\">Click here to see an example of a correctly completed Certificate of Delivery.</a><br /> 2. If you pick up the vehicle yourself without the intervention of a transport company (the vehicle is driven on the road), you will need to have the CoD with you at the moment of pick-up.  So ask our Customer Service department to create your CoD (Certificate of Delivery) if not already done. As soon as your COD is created, you will receive it by email and you will also be able to download it from My account. Take the CoD with you to the pick-up location (with your PuA and damage report). At the pick-up location, fill out and sign the CoD and have it stamped by the pickup location. For more details and exceptions, <a href=\"https://www.adesa.eu/en/cms/faq\">click here</a>. When you arrive at your destination with the vehicle, upload the completely filled out, signed and stamped CoD with a copy of your (driver’s) ID in My account. The uploaded ID of the driver should correspond with the information on the CoD.<br />  3. If you use a transport company to pick up your vehicle, you must upload the duly filled-out CMR and not the Certificate of Delivery using My account, only after reception of the vehicle. Please make sure that your transport company fills out the CMR correctly in order to avoid disapproved CMRs. <a href=\"http://cms.adesa.eu/docs/cms-documents/cmr.pdf\"> Click here to see an example of a correctly completed CMR. </a><br /> <br /> <strong>Be careful  to <u>only upload the Certificate of Delivery or CMR (see supra) after reception of the vehicle</u>, as the mere fact of doing so can be used as confirmation/proof  of reception. </strong><a href=\"https://www.adesa.eu/en/mycotw/purchases\"> Click here to start the uploading process but log in first</a>.",
